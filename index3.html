    So what the heck? Why make a scene of cars driving around in circles and houses that aren't really houses? What gives?
    <br />

    We tend to take normalcy for granted. A suburban neighborhood is simply as it appears --
    a collection of similarly built homes right next to each other, housing families.
    At some point, your eyes tend to overlook details because once you've seen something
    once, twice, dozens of times, your brain convinces itself that it is done with collecting
    information within this area.

    I would like to explore the sense of horror that follows when you realize that something
    is out of the ordinary, right where you believed was safe. What exactly brings happiness?
    Safety? Freedom? Are they both tied to each other or separated?

    I had a conversation with a friend with how I've always seen suburbias as rather unusual,
    since I grew up in the city and did not know what it was like to live in one. Suburbias
    are tied to the American ideas of perfection, along with a nuclear family and probably
    a 9-5 job.

    So what the heck? Why make a scene of cars driving around in circles and houses that aren't really houses? What gives?
    <br />
    <br />
    Well, I'm glad you asked!

    We tend to take normalcy for granted. A suburban neighborhood is simply as it appears --
    a collection of similarly built homes right next to each other, housing families.
    At some point, your eyes tend to overlook details because once you've seen something
    once, twice, dozens of times, your brain convinces itself that it is done with collecting
    information within this area.
    <br />
    <br />
    I would like to explore the sense of sameness and compare it to a limbo, where no
    progress gets made. Everything is in stasis.
